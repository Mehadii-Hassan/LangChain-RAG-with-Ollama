(1)!\\n    \\'google-gla:gemini-1.5-flash\\',\\n    system_prompt=\\'Be concise, reply with one sentence.\\',  # (2)!\\n)\\n\\nresult = agent.run_sync(\\'Where does \"hello world\" come from?\\')  # (3)!\\nprint(result.output)\\n\"\"\"\\nThe first known use of \"hello, world\" was in a 1974 textbook about the C programming language.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n\\nWe configure the agent to use Gemini 1.5\\'s Flash model, but you can also set the model when running the agent.\\nRegister a static system prompt using a keyword argument to the agent.\\nRun the agent synchronously, conducting a conversation with the LLM.\\n\\n(This example is complete, it can be run \"as is\")\\nThe exchange should be very short: PydanticAI will send the system prompt and the user query to the LLM, the model will return a text response.\\nNot very interesting yet, but we can easily add \"tools\", dynamic system prompts, and structured responses to build more powerful agents.\\nTools & Dependency Injection Example\\nHere is a concise example using PydanticAI to build a support agent for a bank:\\nbank_support.pyfrom dataclasses import dataclass\\n\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext\\n\\nfrom bank_database import DatabaseConn\\n\\n\\n@dataclass\\nclass SupportDependencies:  # (3)!\\n    customer_id: int\\n    db: DatabaseConn  # (12)!\\n\\n\\nclass SupportOutput(BaseModel):  # (13)!\\n    support_advice: str = Field(description=\\'Advice returned to the customer\\')\\n    block_card: bool = Field(description=\"Whether to block the customer\\'s card\")\\n    risk: int = Field(description=\\'Risk level of query\\', ge=0, le=10)\\n\\n\\nsupport_agent = Agent(  # (1)!\\n    \\'openai:gpt-4o\\',  # (2)!\\n    deps_type=SupportDependencies,\\n    output_type=SupportOutput,  # (9)!\\n    system_prompt=(  # (4)!\\n        \\'You are a support agent in our bank, give the \\'\\n        \\'customer support and judge the risk level of their query.\\'\\n    ),\\n)\\n\\n\\n@support_agent.system_prompt  # (5)!\\nasync def add_customer_name(ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies]) -> str:\\n    customer_name = await ctx.deps.db.customer_name(id=ctx.deps.customer_id)\\n    return f\"The customer\\'s name is {customer_name!r}\"\\n\\n\\n@support_agent.tool  # (6)!\\nasync def customer_balance(\\n    ctx: RunContext[SupportDependencies], include_pending: bool\\n) -> float:\\n    \"\"\"Returns the customer\\'s current account balance.\"\"\"  # (7)!\\n    return await ctx.deps.db.customer_balance(\\n        id=ctx.deps.customer_id,\\n        include_pending=include_pending,\\n    )\\n\\n\\n...  # (11)!\\n\\n\\nasync def main():\\n    deps = SupportDependencies(customer_id=123, db=DatabaseConn())\\n    result = await support_agent.run(\\'What is my balance?\\', deps=deps)  # (8)!\\n    print(result.output)  # (10)!\\n    \"\"\"\\n    support_advice=\\'Hello John, your current account balance, including pending transactions, is $123.45.\\' block_card=False risk=1\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n    result = await support_agent.run(\\'I just lost my card!\\', deps=deps)\\n    print(result.output)\\n    \"\"\"\\n    support_advice=\"I\\'m sorry to hear that, John. We are temporarily blocking your card to prevent unauthorized transactions.\" block_card=True risk=8\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\n\\nThis agent will act as first-tier support in a bank. Agents are generic in the type of dependencies they accept and the type of output they return. In this case, the support agent has type Agent[SupportDependencies, SupportOutput].\\nHere we configure the agent to use OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o model, you can also set the model when running the agent.\\nThe SupportDependencies dataclass is used to pass data, connections, and logic into the model that will be needed when running system prompt and tool functions. PydanticAI\\'s system of dependency injection provides a type-safe way to customise the behavior of your agents, and can be especially useful when running unit tests and evals.\\nStatic system prompts can be registered with the system_prompt keyword argument to the agent.\\nDynamic system prompts can be registered with the @agent.system_prompt decorator, and can make use of dependency injection. Dependencies are carried via the RunContext argument, which is parameterized with the deps_type from above. If the type annotation here is wrong, static type checkers will catch it.\\ntool let you register functions which the LLM may call while responding to a user. Again, dependencies are carried via RunContext, any other arguments become the tool schema passed to the LLM. Pydantic is used to validate these arguments, and errors are passed back to the LLM so it can retry.\\nThe docstring of a tool is also passed to the LLM as the description of the tool. Parameter descriptions are extracted from the docstring and added to the parameter schema sent to the LLM.\\nRun the agent asynchronously, conducting a conversation with the LLM until a final response is reached. Even in this fairly simple case, the agent will exchange multiple messages with the LLM as tools are called to retrieve an output.\\nThe response from the agent will, be guaranteed to be a SupportOutput, if validation fails reflection will mean the agent is prompted to try again.\\nThe output will be validated with Pydantic to guarantee it is a SupportOutput, since the agent is generic, it\\'ll also be typed as a SupportOutput to aid with static type checking.\\nIn a real use case, you\\'d add more tools and a longer system prompt to the agent to extend the context it\\'s equipped with and support it can provide.\\nThis is a simple sketch of a database connection, used to keep the example short and readable. In reality, you\\'d be connecting to an external database (e.g. PostgreSQL) to get information about customers.\\nThis Pydantic model is used to constrain the structured data returned by the agent. From this simple definition, Pydantic builds the JSON Schema that tells the LLM how to return the data, and performs validation to guarantee the data is correct at the end of the run.\\n\\n\\nComplete bank_support.py example\\nThe code included here is incomplete for the sake of brevity (the definition of DatabaseConn is missing); you can find the complete bank_support.py example here.\\n\\nInstrumentation with Pydantic Logfire\\nTo understand the flow of the above runs, we can watch the agent in action using Pydantic Logfire.\\nTo do this, we need to set up logfire, and add the following to our code:\\nbank_support_with_logfire.py...\\nfrom pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext\\n\\nfrom bank_database import DatabaseConn\\n\\nimport logfire\\n\\nlogfire.configure()  # (1)!\\nlogfire.instrument_asyncpg()  # (2)!\\n\\n...\\n\\nsupport_agent = Agent(\\n    \\'openai:gpt-4o\\',\\n    deps_type=SupportDependencies,\\n    output_type=SupportOutput,\\n    system_prompt=(\\n        \\'You are a support agent in our bank, give the \\'\\n        \\'customer support and judge the risk level of their query.\\'\\n    ),\\n    instrument=True,\\n)\\n\\n\\nConfigure logfire, this will fail if project is not set up.\\nIn our demo, DatabaseConn uses asyncpg to connect to a PostgreSQL database, so logfire.instrument_asyncpg() is used to log the database queries.\\n\\nThat\\'s enough to get the following view of your agent in action:\\n\\n\\n\\nSee Monitoring and Performance to learn more.\\nllms.txt\\nThe PydanticAI documentation is available in the llms.txt format.\\nThis format is defined in Markdown and suited for large language models.\\nTwo formats are available:\\n\\nllms.txt: a file containing a brief description\\n  of the project, along with links to the different sections of the documentation. The structure\\n  of this file is described in details here.\\nllms-full.txt: Similar to the llms.txt file,\\n  but every link content is included. Note that this file may be too large for some LLMs.\\n\\nAs of today, these files cannot be natively leveraged by LLM frameworks or IDEs. Alternatively,\\nan MCP server can be implemented to properly parse the llms.txt\\nfile.\\nNext Steps\\nTo try PydanticAI yourself, follow the instructions in the examples.\\nRead the docs to learn more about building applications with PydanticAI.\\nRead the API Reference to understand PydanticAI\\'s interface.\\n\\n')]\n"
